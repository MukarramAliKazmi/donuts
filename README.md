# Donuts Restaurant Page · [Live Site](https://mukarramalikazmi.github.io/donuts/#/)

A dynamic single-page restaurant website built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and Webpack. This project was created as part of the JavaScript course in **The Odin Project** curriculum.

## Key Features

This project goes beyond the basic assignment requirements by implementing a more robust and scalable structure.

  * **Modular Component Architecture:** The entire application is built with a component-based philosophy. Everything, from the main **layout** and individual **pages** down to smaller UI elements like the **header** and **menu items**, is treated as a self-contained, reusable module. This makes the codebase exceptionally clean, consistent, and easy to scale.
  * **Custom Hash-Based Router:** Instead of simple tab-switching logic, a custom router was built from scratch to manage different page views. This creates a true single-page application (SPA) experience where the content changes dynamically based on the URL hash.
  * **Organized File Structure:** The codebase is thoughtfully organized into distinct directories for `pages`, `layouts`, `components`, `styles`, `utils`, and a `lib` directory for core functionalities like the custom router. This structure maintains a clear separation of concerns and supports the modular design.
  * **Dynamic Rendering:** The entire website content is built and controlled by JavaScript. All HTML elements for pages and components are created and injected into the DOM on the fly.

## Credits

Built entirely by me—no AI code‑generation tools were used. I relied on official documentation (like MDN) and community resources like Stack Overflow when I needed help.

## Assignment

This project was completed for [The Odin Project – Restaurant Page Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page).
